August 2011 - Present: Senior Software Engineer - Site Reliability Engineer at Google Switzerland GmbH.  
Tech Lead of a Youtube Core SRE team. Ensuring youtube.com, a system of astonishing scale and complexity runs smoothly. Migrations, migrations, migrations.  
Knowledge Graph infrastructure. Developed a new critical piece of infrastructure, improving reliability and throughput of the system. My contribution was designing and developing multiple pieces of the system, development of joi  
nt-APIs with teams in different offices. The piece of infrastructure was successfully deployed and it resolved many of the long-standing reliability issues, making the life of many engineers easier.  
Knowledge Graph. Machine learning reconciliation of music entities, several quality launches affecting 0.32% of the search traffic. Proposed and developed a tool to visualize the clusters of entities and debug pairwise scores be  
tween entities of the cluster.  
Maps. Processing user logs, computing metrics and making them accessible to other developers. I was the project lead, developing the system, collaborating with quantitative analysts, privacy reviewers, reaching out to clients, g  
iving presentations. The project is active to this day, its data is integrated into Google My Business. Example.  
Maps. Designed and implemented a high-precision machine-learning system, which greatly decreased the rate of duplicate business listings on the map of Russia.
